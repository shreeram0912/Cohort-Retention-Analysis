# Cohort Retention Analysis (SQL Server, SSIS & Tableau)

### Project Overview
This project demonstrates a Time-Based Cohort Retention Analysis using Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL / SSMS) for data processing, SSIS for ETL (data integration), and Tableau for interactive data visualization.
The goal of the analysis is to understand customer retention behavior over time, identify trends, and measure how many customers return after their first purchase.
